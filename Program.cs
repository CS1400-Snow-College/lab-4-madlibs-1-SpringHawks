//2. greeting Print a greeting and description of the program to the user. (Remember to run, add, and commit.)
//3. taking the string apart Here is a code snippet to load the story into a single string:
//string originalStory = "A vacation is when you take a trip to some (adjective) place with your
//(adjective) family. Usually, you go to some place that is near a/an (noun) or up on a/an (noun).
//A good vacation place is one where you can ride (plural noun) or play (game) or go hunting for (plural noun).
//I like to spend my time (verb ending in “ing”) or (verb ending in “ing”).
//When parents go on a vacation, they spend their time eating three (plural noun) a day, and fathers play golf,
//and mothers sit around (verb ending in “ing”) Last summer, my little brother fell in a/an (noun) and got poison
//(plant) all over his (part of the body) My family is going to go to (place) and I will practice (verb ending in “ing”)
//Parents need vacations more than kids because parents are always very (adjective) and because they have to work
//(number) hours every day all year making enough (plural noun) to pay for the vacation.";
//You may use this madlibs example or make up your own
//string[] storyWords = originalStory.Split(' '); // This should hopefully split original story into words
//4. analyze each word- look at each word and consider the first character.
//If it not a parenthesis add it to the 'newStory' along with a space
//If it is a parenthesis, ask the user to provide you with an example of the word type in the
//parenthesis and add that word to the 'newStory' along with a space
//5. display the new story- Print it out when you're done story can you make it print "frog."
//with the period when it prints out the story at the end? (+5 extra credit)
